# Builder

## Intent

**Builder** is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.  
The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

## Problem
Imagine a complex object that requires laborious, step-by-step initialization of many fields and nested objects. 
Such initialization code is usually buried inside a monstrous constructor with lots of parameters. 
Or even worse: scattered all over the client code.
