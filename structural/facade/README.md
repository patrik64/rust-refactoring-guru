# Facade

## Intent

**Facade** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library,  
a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## Problem

Imagine that you must make your code work with a broad set of objects that belong to a sophisticated library or framework.  
Ordinarily, youâ€™d need to initialize all of those objects, keep track of dependencies, execute methods in the correct order, and so on.

As a result, the business logic of your classes would become tightly coupled to the implementation details of 3rd-party classes,  
making it hard to comprehend and maintain.
